# Project: Predicting Board Game Reviews

Board games have been making a comeback lately, and deeper, more strategic boardgames, like Settlers of Catan have become hugely popular. A popular site where these types of board games are discussed and reviewed is BoardGameGeek.

In this project, we'll be working with a dataset that contains 80000 board games and their associated review scores. The data was scraped from BoardGameGeek and compiled into CSV format by [Sean Beck](https://github.com/ThaWeatherman/scrapers/blob/master/boardgamegeek/games.csv). 

## Install
This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3.x installer.

## Code
All the code is in the notebook `predicting_board_game_reviews.ipynb`.

## Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory titanic_survival_exploration/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```
jupyter notebook predicting_board_game_reviews.ipynb
```

or
```
ipython notebook predicting_board_game_reviews.ipynb
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your web browser.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is `board_games.csv`. This dataset is provided by  [Sean Beck](https://github.com/ThaWeatherman/scrapers/blob/master/boardgamegeek/games.csv).
